This is my [(Steve Hanlon) Portfolio website](https://sixstringscoder.github.io/) as a computer programmer.

I'm using a Bootstrap template called [Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) as the foundation.

I've used jQuery and CSS to add interactivity.

The site currently shows a _Django_ built website, a _WordPress_ website, a _Moodle_ educational website, a _Corona SDK-built_ app, and my personal music website using HTML, CSS, Flexbox and JavaScript.

*Features to come:*
- graphs populated from AJAX calls,
- tables populated through web-scraping
- bus stop app utilizing AJAX calls with Google Map APIs
